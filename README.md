# research project: off-resonant static dephasing
Bloch simulation including relaxation and Cauchy-distributed static off-resonance (T2′) based on the Cayley-Klein simulation by Prof.Dr. Tony Stöckert from https://github.com/pulseq/MR-Physics-with-Pulseq/blob/main/tutorials/02_rf_pulses/notebooks/se2d_sliceprofile_solution.ipynb
Simulates slice-selective excitation with Cauchy-distributed static off-resonance (T2′) and compares full simulation vs hard-pulse approximation.
